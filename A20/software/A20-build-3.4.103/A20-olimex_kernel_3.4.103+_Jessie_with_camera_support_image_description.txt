Official Images from OLIMEX for A20-SOM, A20-OLinuXino-MICRO, A20-OLinuXino-LIME, A20-OLinuXino-LIME2 boards

Note: the SD card images for A20 boards which we have on our webshop contain same image on 8GB Class10 fast micro sd-card, 
if you want to use this image please use Class10 fast card or the performance of Linux will slow down
The image is Debian Jessie linux with kernel 3.4.103+ . 
Default login/password: root/olimex

Note that below with XXX is marked the type of Olimex's A20 board, i.e. according the board you use XXX can be OLinuXino_Micro, Lime2, SOM or Lime.
Y in image file name is the number of image revision. 

The file a20-XXX_debian_Jessie_34_103_2G_release_Y.img.7z is an archive of
a20-XXX_debian_Jessie_34_103_2G_release_Y.img file. 
So in order to write the image on SD card you have to unzip a20-XXX_debian_Jessie_34_103_2G_release_Y.img.7z file:
1.1 for Windows
----------------
Use 7zip and then use Win32DiskImager.exe (http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) for image writing

1.2 for linux
-------------
Use p7zip package. If you have no installed 7zip then type 
#apt-get install p7zip
Copy a20-XXX_debian_Jessie_34_103_2G_release_Y.img.7z file in your directory and unzip it with 
#7za e a20-XXX_debian_Jessie_34_103_2G_release_Y.img.7z
The output should be a new 2GB file named a20-XXX_debian_Jessie_34_103_2G_release_Y.img.
Put 2,4,8,16 GB SD card in your card reader and type
# ls /dev/sd
Then press two times <TAB> you will see a list of your sd devices like sda sdb sdc note that some of these devices may be your hard disk so 
make sure you know which one is your sd card before you proceed as you can damage your HDD if you choose the wrong sd-device. 
You can do this by unplugging your sd card reader and identify which "sd" devices remove from the list.
Once you know which device is your sdcard like sda use this text instead of the sdX name in the references below:

#dd if=a20-XXX_debian_Jessie_34_103_2G_release_Y.img of=/dev/sdX

Note that the image is 2GB and if you write it on bigger SD card it is reccomended to resize it in order to use all SD card space
From root directory start resize_sd.sh script with the following parameters

# ./resize_sd.sh /dev/mmcblk0 2

The list of all installed packages is located in debian_jessie_installed_packages.txt file

The main tested onboard hardware modules are:

- GPIO	-	they are located in /sys/class/gpio directory. Note that first you have to export GPIOs. For example:
# for i in `seq 1 1 230`; do echo $i > /sys/class/gpio/export; done
will export all available GPIOs
# echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpioXX_pxx/direction
will make the port output
# echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpioXX_pXX/value
will make the port output in logical 1
- LCD		-	4.3''(480x272), 7''(800x480), 10''(1024x600), 15''(1366x768), 15''(1080x1920)
- SATA	-	with power on/off control and battery support
- HDMI	-	the default HDMI resolution is 720p50(720x1280 - 50 Hz)
- Touch_screen	-	you need calibrate LCD before using touch screen. Use X environment to do that. 
Lounch Calibrate Touchscreen application from Preferences menu(press the button in down left corner)
In order to save calibration data it is better to copy values from the window that appears after calibrations to Option "Calibration" section 
in  /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf file
It is something like 
Option "Calibration" "3999 66 198 3938"
For example use 
# nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf

- ASIX8877 USB-LAN	-	https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/A13/USB-ETHERNET-AX88772B/. Usually it is eth1 interface
- USB WEB camera A4TECH
- WIFI_RTL8188	-	https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/Ethernet/MOD-WIFI-RTL8188/. Note that you have to set your SSID network and your password in /etc/network/interfaces file
- MOD-WIFI-R5370	-	https://www.olimex.com/Products/USB-Modules/MOD-WIFI-R5370. Note that you have to set your SSID network and your password in /etc/network/interfaces file
- USB_OTG		-	low/full/high USB host 
Note that you can use USB_OTG for SSH connection without need of LAN cable or serial cable. You can use only mini USB cable connected between your host PC
and the onboard mini USB connector. For connection convenience there is started a DHCP server only for USB0 interface. So the DHCP server should give IP address
to the new USB0 interface of your host PC and you can make SSH connection from your PC to the default board IP address of USB0 interface - 192.168.2.1
- USB_HOST_up		-	low/full/high USB host
- USB_HOST_down	-	low/full/high USB host
- MOD-USB3G	-	https://www.olimex.com/Products/USB-Modules/MOD-USB3G/. In order to test MOD-USB3G module you have to place SIM card(without pin code) in module 
and connect it to USB host connector, change settings in /etc/wvdial.conf file according to your mobile operator and type:
# wvdial 3gconnect
- mico_SD_card	- linux starts from micro_SD card
- second_SD_card	-	with card present capability 
- ETHERNET	-	100Mb/1000Mb. By default the board IP address is 192.168.1.254. So if you want to connect with the board using SSH client 
(for example Putty(http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)) then you have to use this address. 
You can change this address from /etc/network/interface file. 
Note that for internet connection you have to set your gateway address in /etc/network/interdaces file and 
you have to set your DNS server in /etc/resolv.conf(for example nameserver 192.168.1.1)
- MIC IN	-	for example:
# arecord -f dat -r 60000 -D hw:0,0 -d 5 test.wav
this command will record 5 sec audio stream from microphone in test.wav file 
- Headphone OUT	-	for example
# aplay -D hw:0,0 test.wav
this command will play the audio stream from test.wav file
- NAND support	-	/dev/nandX
- I2C2(100KHz)	-	/dev/i2c-2
- I2C1(100KHz)	-	/dev/i2c-1
- UART4(only for A20-Lime and A20-Lime2)	-	/dev/ttyS1
- UART6(only for A20-SOM, A20-OLinuXino-MICRO)	-	/dev/ttyS1
- UART7(only for A20-SOM, A20-OLinuXino-MICRO)	-	/dev/ttyS2
- SPI1((only for A20-SOM, A20-OLinuXino-MICRO))	-	/dev/spidev1.0
- SPI2	-	/dev/spidev2.0
there is a simple test for SPI2 in /opt/spidev directory. 
# ls /opt/spidev
max6675/
in folder max6675/ there is example related with MOD-TC(https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/Sensors/MOD-TC/open-source-hardware) - temperature sensor that you have to connect to UEXT1 connector
# cd max6675
# ./MAX6675
the last command will read temperature from MOD-TC thermocouple
- BUTTONs	- we use evtest package for testing. For example:
# evtest
then enter event number for keyboard and now you can press the BUTTONs and you should see the result on terminal window
- on board camera support (only for A20-SOM-EVB)
You can do a simple camera test if you paste the next command 
# mplayer -fps 60  -tv driver=v4l2:width=640:height=480:device=/dev/video0 tv:// 
and see camera stream to fremebufer output you set - HDMI, VGA or LCD
- USB Gadjetsls 
You can use mini USB connector to connect with the board via SSH. 
Note that USB0 interface IP address by default  is 192.168.2.1 Therefore the host IP address has to be in this network - 192.168.2.xxx(except 192.168.2.1)
Use login:olimex and password:olimex to connect with the board.
- Nand
If you want to use NAND flash memory istead of SD card you can transfer the current image from the SD card to NAND flash. So you can use boot linux only from NAND without using SD card
For this purpose type 
# nandistall

Be pation. This operation will take around 10 min

Changing A20-XXX  HDMI, LCD or VGA resolution 
---------------------------------------------------
The default SD card setup is made with settings for HDMI 720p/50Hz. If you want to change some other LCD, VGA or HDMI resolution then you have to start 
change_display_a20_olimex.sh script file in /root directory.
Type:
#  change_display.sh

and choose the desired resolution of desired interface(LCD, HDMI or VGA)
The supported resolution are:

About LCD:
1. 4.3''(480x272)
2. 7''(800x480)
3. 10''(1024x600)
4. 15.6''(1366x768)
5. 15.6''-FHD(1920x1080)

- About 15.6 and 15.6-FHD LCD you can control backlight and DCR(Dinamic Contrast Ratio) using a soft pwm module. The main goal is to decrease power consumption. For example 
# echo 50 > /sys/class/softpwm/backlight/duty
will decrease the LCD backlight to 50%
the parameter for duty is between 0 and 100
# echo 10 > /sys/class/softpwm/duty
will decrease the LCD contrast
the parameter 10 for duty is between 0 and 100 

- About 4.3'', 7'' and 10'' LCD  you can control only backlight a hardware pwm module. The main goal is to decrease power consumption. For example 
# echo 50 > /sys/class/pwm-sunxi/pwm0/duty_percent
will decrease the LCD backlight to 50%
the parameter for duty_percent is between 0 and 100

About HDMI:
0. 480i
1. 576i
2. 480p
3. 576p
4. 720p50
5. 720p60
6. 1080i50
7. 1080i60
8. 1080p24
9. 1080p50
10. 1080p60

About VGA: note that the VGA signals are routed to custom 6 pin connector and you need from adapter to standart VGA connector
0. 1680x1050
1. 1440x900
2. 1360x768
3. 1280x1024
4. 1024x768
5. 800x600
6. 640x480
7. 1920x1080
8. 1280x720 

Changing script.bin file
========================
Note that you have to be very carefull with script.bin changing because the system can stop working. It is recommeded to make backup of script.bin file before change it.

If you want to convert script.bin file from sdcard to script.fex file first you have to mount the first sdcard patition 
# mount  /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt
use bin2fex script to convert and script.bin to script.fex
# bin2fex /mnt/script.bin script.fex
Now you can change the board modules and parameters, save the changes and exit from nano editor
# nano script.fex
save and exit
now you have to convert script.fex to script.bin and replace it
# fex2bin script.fex /mnt/script.bin
and reboot 
# reboot
