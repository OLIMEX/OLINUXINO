Formatting and setting up the SD card
==============================

This document details how to create a bootable card after you have done building the image from scratch. 
If you are using the ready image, you shouldn't follow this guide (just write the ready-to-use official 
image (available as torrent) to the card with "dd" or "Win32 Disk Imager".

In order to follow this guide you would need several tools. You need to use a Linux computer. This guide
assumes that you use a Linux PC. You would need an SD card and an SD card writer/reader. We suggest using
a class 10 microSD card with memory capacity of at least 4GB. We haven't tested microSD cards bigger than
16GB. 

First we have to make the correct card partitions using fdisk. Plug the card into the SD card reader and type
in the terminal:

# ls /dev/sd

Then press two times <TAB> and you will see a list of sd devices like sda sdb sdc. Note that some of these
devices would be your hard disk so ensure that you know which one is your sd card before you proceed as you can
damage your HDD if you choose the wrong sd-device. You can do this by unplugging your sd card reader - pay
attention which "sd" device disappears from the list.

Once you know which one is your microSD (as sda#) use it instead of the sdX name in the references below:

# fdisk /dev/sdX

then:

p

will list your partitions. If there are already partitions on your card do:

press d enter 1

if you have more than one partition press d to delete them all

create the first partition, starting from 40960, 50MB of size:

n enter p enter 1 enter 40960 enter +50M

create second partition, starting from 143360

n enter p enter 2 enter 143360

then list the created partitions:

p enter

set file system type:

press t, choose c type(W95 FAT32 (LBA)) for the first partition

if you did everything correctly on 4GB card you should see something like:

Disk /dev/sdc: 3980 MB, 3980394496 bytes
123 heads, 62 sectors/track, 1019 cylinders, total 7774208 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x00000000

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdc1           40960      143359       51200    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)
/dev/sdc2          143360     7774207     3815424   83  Linux

write changes to sd card:

press w

Now we have to format the file system on the card (the first partition should be vfat as this is FS which the
Allwinner bootloader understands):

# mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX1

The second should be normal Linux EXT3 FS:

# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX2

write boot0.bin 
# sudo dd if=a64-olinuxino/blobs/boot0.bin conv=notrunc bs=1k seek=8 of=/dev/sdX

write u-boot
# sudo dd conv=notrunc bs=1k seek=19096 if=a64-olinuxino/build/u-boot-sun50iw1p1-secure-with-teres-dtb.bin of=/dev/sdX

mount first sd card partition
# sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt

download first sd card partition files
# wget https://github.com/OLIMEX/OLINUXINO/raw/master/SOFTWARE/A64/A64-ubuntu_built_preliminary_rel_2/a64_first_partition_rel2.tgz

extract to first partition on the sd card
# sudo tar xzvf a64_first_partition_rel2 -C /mnt

download device tree file a64-olinuxino.dtb 
# wget https://github.com/OLIMEX/OLINUXINO/raw/master/SOFTWARE/A64/A64-ubuntu_built_preliminary_rel_2/a64-olinuxino.dtb

copy the a64-olinuxino.dtb ti first sd card partition 
# cp  a64-olinuxino.dtb /mnt/A64

copy kernel image to first partition
# cp linux-a64/arch/arm64/boot/Image /mnt/A64

umount first sd card partition and mount the second
# sudo umount /dev/sdX1 
# sudo mount /dev/sdX2 /mnt

download the Ubuntu file system or use your own
# wget https://www.olimex.com/wiki/images/b/bf/A64-olinuxino_ubuntu_fs_rel_1.torrent

extract the file system archive
# sudo tar xzvf a64-olinuxino_ubuntu_fs_rel_1.tgz -C /mnt

remove the current modules
# sudo rm -rf /mnt/lib/modules/3.10.104

copy compiled kernel modules
# cp -rfv a64-olinuxino/linux-a64/out/lib/modules/3.10.104 /mnt/lib/modules
# sync
# sudo umount /dev/sdX2
