This repository contains:

Original hardware design files for A13-OLinuXino and A13-OLinuXino-WIFI.
These are made with Eagle 4.16r2.
PDF exports are available also.

Both boards use same design files, but the A13-OLinuXino-WIFI comes with NAND memory and on-board MOD-WIFI-RTL8188ETV module.

Notice that it is possible that simultaneously purchased A13-OLinuXino and A13-OLinuXino-WIFI to be from different revisions.
