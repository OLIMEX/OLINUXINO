<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h3>I bought A13-LCD4.3TS but there is no ready Android for it. Where can I find it?</h3>

<p>The display is too small to be used with our latest Android releases.
Please either use Debian or get a 7" or 10" inch display.</p>

<h3>I bought A13-LCD4.3TS but when I connect it to the A13-OLinuXino I receive no image on the display. What do I do wrong?</h3>

<p>The default A13-OLinuXino image is set for a VGA display and 800x600 resolution.
To use LCD with A13-OLinuXino you need to run a configuration script.
