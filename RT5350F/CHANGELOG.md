# Changes

## 01 NOV 2016

* Added images and instructions suitable for restoring the firmware of RT5350F-OLinuXino and RT5350F-OLinuXino-EVB (mtd2 partition restore)

## 03 MAR 2016

* Added image RT5350F-OLinuXino-DIN
* Renamed uboot+factory+openwrt.bin to FlashImage_RT5350F_OLinuXino_EVB.bin
* Added FlashImage_RT5350F_OLinuXino_DIN.bin

## 10 NOV 2015

* Fixed issue with MAC address.
They were hard-coded in the factory partition.
Now on the first boot a random one is generated and stored.

The updated files are:
- uboot+factory.bin
- uboot+factory+openwrt.bin

The difference is ONLY in the factory partition.
OpenWRT remains the same.
The MAC address was hard-coded at offset 0x40004.
We set WLAN,
MAC0 and MAC1 MAC addresses to ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.
This forces the chip to generate random one on every boot.
On the first boot this MAC is stored on the filesystem.

## 24 AUG 2015

* Now modules for USB storage are [*] instead of [M]

## 17 AUG 2015

* Changed OpenWrt repository url from snapshots to Chaos Calmer 15.05-rc3
* Updated WiFi led polarity
* Added separate images for OLinuXino-RT5350F and EVB.
The difference is that on the EVB the button and the two relays are exported on boot time.
