OpenCV + Python fun with A13-OLinuXino-WIFI
===========================================

OpenCV is open source huge image processing library. It was build by thousands of contributors for many years.
Now OpenCV is so powerful that you can make with the latest 2.4 revision even face recognition, gesture analysis and any kind of image filtering and enhancements.

There are tons of funny projects based on OpenCV like these videos: 
- face tracking http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH89ZkV2jtE
- face expression analysis http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6xNqPPSKtM
- hand gesture recognition http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th8hUD7Ajg4
- make cool interactive systems http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeQwhujiWVk
- object tracking - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkWkCpYc3CA
- track your eye and face activity http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCtYdUEMotg
- using code like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CigGvt3DXIw you can make your robot to chase pong ball in the field

so you can see OpenCV opens endless interesting interactive projects.

The best of all is that OpenCV runs fine on A13-OLinuXino-WIFI so instead to use big desktop for OpenCV you can use A13-OLinuXino which consumes only 2W of energy and can be placed on your robot and powered just from LiPo 3.7V battery.

Installing OpenCV on A13-OLinuXino
----------------------------------
1. Make sure that your image support cams:

# ls -l /dev/video*

You should have video0 or video1. The demo uses video0.

2. Install OpenCV

# apt-get install libopencv-dev
(If you dont want all packages, use core dist)

3. Install Python

# apt-get install python-dev
(This will install Python2.7)

4. Get OpenCV support for python

# apt-get install python-opencv



Now you are ready to develop with OpenCV on A13-OLinuXino!

Our first "Hello world" example will be simple, we will run Apache web server, then with OpenCV will take pictures every 5 seconds and once per minute will store to the SD-card.
This way you can make time elapsed videos like this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU3DBvmaR3g

-------------
from cv2 import *	#import opencv module
import sys		#import system module

def main():
    cam = VideoCapture(0)	#tell opencv where to take pictures from in this case from /dev/video0
    index = 1			#this is the picture index

    while True:			#search the SD-card for previous pictures to calc last picture index (in case of power failure for instance which interrupted the picture save process)
        test = imread("img" + str(index) + ".jpg")
	if test == None:
	    break
	else:
	    index += 1

    while True:
	for i in range(12):	# wait 12 * 5 seconds = 1 minute to save picture
            s, img = cam.read()	# capture the picture, s is flag which =1 if capture is successful
            if s:
	        imwrite("capture.jpg", img)
	    else:
		sys.exit(-1)
	    waitKey(5000)	# just wait 5 seconds and do nothing

        imwrite("img" + str(index) + ".jpg", img) # save the picture to SD-card and increase picture index
	print("img" + str(index) + ".jpg")
        index += 1
        
    return 0

if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()
------------

now let's setup the web server so we can see the pictures with web interface:

5. Get Apache (or whatever else you want)

# apt-get install apache2

the code on the web page is simple:

------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>CAM FEED</h2>
<img border="0" src="images/capture.jpg" alt="Capture go here...">

</body>
</html>
------------

this code is already in the tar.gz file at GitHub: ....

6. Go to www-dir

# cd /var/www/
# mkdir CAM
# cd CAM
# tar zxf demo.tar.gz .

7. Go to images folder and start the python module

# python images/cam2.py &

8. Open browser and enter the address where your A13 is connected:

http://192.168.0.xx/CAM/

9. You should see images every 5 sec. Additionally every 1 minute a image is saved on the SD-card.
