1. Extract the tarball into your www directory. For example:
#tar -zxvf door.tar.gz /var/www/door/

2. Get pyA13 package:
#wget --no-check-sertificate https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pyA13/pyA13-0.1.12.tar.gz
#tar -zxvf pyA13-0.1.12.tar.gz
#cd pyA13-0.1.12
#python setup.py install

3. Get OpenCV
#apt-get install libopencv-dev python-opencv

4. Install some http server (I use Apache2) and PHP5
#apt-get install apache2 php5

5. Connect a camera to the A13
6. Connect some button to the board. In this demo a SPDT switch is used. The pole is connected to PIN36. If you
want to use another modify cam3.py by replacing PIN36 to PINxx. Also look for input logic levels. In this demo 
the input is active low (idle is high).
7. Start http server
8. Start python module
#python cam3.py &

9. Open some browser and type you localhost address, for example "http://192.168.0.100/cam/"
Every time when someone open the door a picture is taken, and you should see him :)
