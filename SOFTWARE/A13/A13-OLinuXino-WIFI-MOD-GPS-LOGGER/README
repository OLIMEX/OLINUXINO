A13-OLinuXino-WIFI + MOD-GPS GPS data logger with Google maps vsualization

A13-OLinuXino-WIFI can connect directly to MOD-GPS via UEXT connector, also A13-OLinuXino-WIFI have LiPo battery connector and can charge Lithium Polymer batteries and work without external power supply just on battery.
This allow us to make very nice GPS logger demo with just A13-OLinuXino-WIFI + LiPo battery + MOD-GPS

This project reads GPS info and log the coordinates then create flypath with them.

To start server use following commands:
#apt-get install update

#apt-get install apache2
(Or other server on your choice...)

#apt-get install php5

Then you can configure it as you want... or not. 

If you're using DHCP check the ip:
#ifconfig -a

You should view the current IP address, for example 192.168.0.100

Open some browser and type 192.168.0.100. On the page should be "It works!".

Go to /var/www/ dir and extract the project
#cd /var/www/
#tar -zxvf /path/to/archieve/GPS.tar.gz .

#cd /GPS
#chmod 777 GPS2.py LOG
#ls -l *

And you can see permitions

Open index.php and find the line:
        <script type="text/javascript" src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY&sensor=false">
        
Replace YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY with your own key. Visit https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key.


Once you enter your key and save the file, go again to your browser and enter the address "192.168.0.100/GPS".
A google maps should load.

UART1 MUST be disabled.
#vi /etc/inittab
Comment the line: "T0:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L -a root ttyS0 115200 vt102"
Save the file and reboot.
!!!Before rebooting you should have working SSH



After the reboot login with SSH and connect A13 with MOD-GPS.

To log coords type:
#cd /var/www/GPS
Remove demo coords:
#rm LOG
#python GPS2.py

This will collect data every 1 minute. While this is running (or in the background) go for a walk :) .

Once you're home stop the process.
Go to your browser and enter the demo address.

Click load file.
Now you should see flypath and the logged coordinates. :)
