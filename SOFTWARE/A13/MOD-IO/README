# make

After that execute the program

# ./mod-io [param] [address] [data]

2) Get states of the digital inputs of the board. 
# ./mod-io -dig 0x58

3) Get the voltage applied to one of the analogue inputs of the board.
# ./mod-io -an1 0x58
# ./mod-io -an2 0x58
# ./mod-io -an3 0x58
# ./mod-io -an4 0x58

4) Set new slave address to the board.
# ./mod-io -address 0x58 <new>	->	At the moment of sending this command the BTN must be pressed.
