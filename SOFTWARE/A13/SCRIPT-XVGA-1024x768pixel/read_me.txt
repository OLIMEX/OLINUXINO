Changing A13-OLinuxino setings to XGA 1024x768 mode

The default SD card setup is made with settings for VGA 800x600 resolution.
If you want to change resolution to VGA 1024x768 then you have to replace the existing script.bin file from the first SD card partitition (note that this partitition is FAT - so you can replace the file under Windows or Linux) with the script.bin file from this directory.
