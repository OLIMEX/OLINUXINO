# Create a bootable SD card A33-OLinuXino with ALLINNER kernel 3.4.39 and Linux Debian Jessie file system

## Chapter 1. Setting up the software tools

First, make sure that you have the software tools needed to compile the Linux Kernel.
You'd have to install these if you don't have them already installed.
To perform most of the operations below you should be logged as a user with super user rights on your Linux machine.
Type in the terminal:

```bash
sudo su
```

You will be prompted for your password and then your command line would start with ``#`` which means that you are now logged as the super user, all commands listed below should be executed in this mode.

Next update apt-get links by typing:

```bash
apt-get update
```

Next install the same compiler toolchain that we used here by typing the following:

```bash
apt-get install build-essential git qemu-user-static debootstrap binfmt-support gcc-5-arm-linux-gnueabihf
```

This will install:

- GCC compiler
- GIT that allows you to download from the github which holds source code for some of the system
- some other tools for building the kernel

Note that if you use debian may be you will need to add:

```shell
deb http://www.emdebian.org/debian squeeze main
```

in the file below:

```shell
/etc/apt/sources.list
```

You would also need a torrent client.
It is required to be able to download the file system.
Any torrent client would do the job, as long as it can process .torrent files.

At this point you should have have all important tools to make your very own A33 kernel image!

## Chapter 2. Building mainline u-boot

First create the directory where we would build the Linux:

```bash
mkdir a33-olimex
cd a33-olimex
```

Then download the latest mainline u-boot sources from GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git
```

After the download you should have a new directory, naviagate into it with:

```bash
cd u-boot/
```

The image is tested with the commit from  Mon Jul 4 11:46:21 2016 -0400

To switch from the latest sources to the exact commit that we used execute the next command:

```bash
git reset --hard  e8009beff6d5c55c1bf1ae8184791f167e6378b0
```

**MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE REVERTED TO THE SAME COMMIT OR NOTHING BELOW WOULD WORK!**

For compiling u-boot sources we use arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc 5.4.0-6 version 

You can check this with:

```bash
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc --version
```

the result has to be:

```bash
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc (Debian 5.4.0-6) 5.4.0 20160609
```

so if something goes wrong it is better to use tested compiler version

Now you have to make a patch in order to add configuration file for A33. 

Download the a33.patch using the next command:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OLIMEX/OLINUXINO/master/SOFTWARE/A33/A33-build-3-4-39-1/a33.patch
patch -p1 < a33.patch
```

Load the a33 configuration file:

```bash
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-  A33-OLinuXino_defconfig
```

If you want to change other board settings in u-boot you can use the following command:

```bash
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- menuconfig
```

Save and Exit.

Now type the next command to compile the u-boot:

```bash
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
```

At the end of the process you can check if everything is OK by using:

```bash
ls u-boot.bin u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin spl/sunxi-spl.bin
```

Output:

```bash
spl/sunxi-spl.bin  u-boot.bin  u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin
```

If you got these files everything is complete, well done so far

```bash
cd ..
```

You should be in the following directory:

```bash
/home/user/a33-olimex#
```

## Chapter 3. Building linux kernel and modules from sources for A33-OLinuXino boards

The kernel sources for A33 are available at the project git repository. 
You can download the latest kernel sources using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hehopmajieh/a33_linux
```

Note that the our build uses this exact commit: 

```shell
ff599da01cd39f2fac67e74a2085e57afa2ee9d3  from Thu Aug 25 14:05:45 2016 +0300
```

You can switch to this exact commit with the next command:

```bash
git reset --hard ff599da01cd39f2fac67e74a2085e57afa2ee9d3
```

After the download navigate to the kernel directory:

```bash
cd  a33_linux/
```

## 3.3 Configuring the rest of the environment

First you need to set the proper compiler.
For kernel sources we use ``gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabi-2012.02-20120222`` compiler 

Download it:

```bash
wget https://launchpad.net/linaro-toolchain-binaries/trunk/2012.02/+download/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabi-2012.02-20120222_linux.tar.bz2
```

and untar it for example in /opt folder:

```bash
tar jxfv gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabi-2012.02-20120222_linux.tar.bz2 -C /opt
```

Set PATH environment to compiler toolchain:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabi-2012.02-20120222_linux/bin/
```

Load a33 configuration file:

```bash
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- a33Olinuxino_defconfig
```

The result should be:

configuration written to .config

If you wish to make changes to the kernel configuration execute the following:

```bash
make ARCH=arm menuconfig
```

The menuconfig changes a .config text file, which you can view/edit even with a text editor like vi, nano.
Using this command you can add or remove different modules for the different peripherials in the kernel.
Be careful when you change these settings because the kernel can stop working properly.

Now you may continue with kernel image compiling:

```bash
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- -j4 uImage
```

When this completes, you will have uImage ready and the result should be:

The next step is building the kernel modules:

```bash
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- -j4 INSTALL_MOD_PATH=out modules
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- -j4 INSTALL_MOD_PATH=out modules_install
```

Note that in order to use onboard NAND flash you have to compile the NAND module separately.
For this purpose:

```bash
cd a33-linux/modules/nand
```

and make

```bash
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- LICHEE_KDIR=/home/user/a33_linux/
```

The nand.ko module should be in:

```bash
a33_linux/modules/nand/sun8iw5p1/nand.ko
```

Copy nand.ko file in out/lib/modules/3.4.39+/kernel/drivers/

```bash
cp modules/nand/sun8iw5p1/nand.ko  lib/modules/3.4.39+/kernel/drivers/
```

DONE!
At this point you have uboot and kernel modules.

The uImage file is located in a33_linux/arch/arm/boot/

The kernel modules are located in linux-sunxi/out/lib/modules/3.x.xx where 3.x.xx is kernel version.
In our case the directory with modules is:

```bash
out/lib/modules/3.4.39+/
```

## 4. Format and setup the SD-card

We suggest using a class 10 microSD card with memory capacity at least 8GB.
We haven't tested microSD cards bigger than 16GB.

First we have to make the correct card partitions using fdisk.
Plug SD card into your SD card reader and enter in the terminal:

```bash
ls /dev/sd
```

Then press <TAB> twice.
You will see a list of your sd devices like sda, sdb, sdc, etc.
Note that some of these devices may be your hard disk, so make sure you know which one is your sd card before you proceed!
Otherwise, you can easily destroy data on your HDD if you choose the wrong sd-device.
You can do this by unplugging your sd card reader and note which "sd" device disappears from the list.

Once you know which one is your microSD (as sda#) use it instead of the sdX name in the references below:

```bash
fdisk /dev/sdX
```

then:

```
p
```

will list your partitions.
If there are already partitions on your card do:

```
d
enter
1
```

if you have more than one partitition press ``d`` will delete them all.

Create the first partition, starting from 2048:

```
n
enter
p
enter
1
enter
enter
enter
```

then list the created partitions:

```
p
enter
```

If you did everything correctly on a 2GB card, you should see something like:

```
Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/sdd: 1.9 GiB, 2001731584 bytes, 3909632 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x10a769e1

Device     Boot Start     End Sectors  Size Id Type
/dev/sdd1        2048 3909631 3907584  1.9G 83 Linux
```

Press ``w`` to write changes to the sd card.

Now we have to format the file system on the card.
For example ext4 file system.
Execute the command mkfs.ext4 with these parameters. 

```bash
mkfs.ext4 -O ^metadata_csum,^64bit /dev/sdX1
```

## 5. Write the Uboot and u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin

You should be in /home/user/a33-olimex# directory .

Note that you have to write u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin in /dev/sdX (not sdX1 or sdX2)

Type:

```bash
cd u-boot
dd if=u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/sdX bs=1024 seek=8
```

The result should be something like this:

```
422+1 records in
422+1 records out
433112 bytes (433 kB, 423 KiB) copied, 0.0952634 s, 4.5 MB/s
```

## 6. Debian rootfs

The Linux Kernel and Uboot are ready, now we need the Linux distribution rootfs.

Basically, the only difference between the different Linux distributions is the rootfs.
If you place a Debian rootfs, you will have Debian; if you place an Ubuntu rootfs it will be Ubuntu, etc.

How to build one is a long topic!
The good thing is that there are many already pre-built so we can just download one and use it ready.

Now leave the kernel directory:

```bash
cd ..
```

Should be in the directory below:

```bash
/home/user/a33-olimex
```

Download debian rootfs with the file name "a33-jessie-FS-rel1.tgz", which is available only as a torrent.
You would need a torrent client for it (Azureus, uTorrent, qBittorrent, etc).
The link to the torrent file is:

```bash
wget https://github.com/OLIMEX/OLINUXINO/raw/master/SOFTWARE/A33/A33-build-3-4-39-1/a33-jessie-FS-rel1.tgz.torrent
```

Launch the torrent client and download the file.

Now mount the microSD card EXT4 FS partition:

```bash
mkdir /mnt/sd
mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/sd
```

and unarchive the rootfs:

```bash
tar xzvf a33-jessie-FS-rel1.tgz -C /mnt/sd
ls /mnt/sd
```

The correct result should be:

```
bin   dev  home  lost+found  mnt  proc  run   selinux  sys  usr
boot  etc  lib   media       opt  root  sbin  srv      tmp  var
```

Now you have to replace the newly generated kernel and modules from /home/user/a33-olimex/a33_linux/out/lib/modules/ to the new Debian file system.

## 7. Write the kernel uImage to the SD-card

You should be in the directory below:

/home/user/a33-olimex# directory

Copy the Kernel uImage to boot directory in partition 1:

```bash
cp a33_linux/arch/arm/boot/uImage /mnt/sd/boot
```

Now you have to replace kernel modules

```bash
rm -rf /mnt/sd/lib/modules/*
cp -rfv a33_linux/out/lib/modules/3.x.xx+/ /mnt/sd/lib/modules/
```

where x.xx is the kernel version.
Replace /lib/firmware folder with the generated /linux-sunxi/out/firmware

```bash
cp -rfv a33_linux/out/lib/firmware/ /mnt/sd/lib/
sync
```

## 7. Write script.bin file

script.bin is a very important file with parameters like port GPIO assignments, DDR memory parameters, video resolution etc.
For A33-OLinuXino you can download it using the following command:

```bash
wget https://github.com/OLIMEX/OLINUXINO/raw/master/SOFTWARE/A33/A33-build-3-4-39-1/script.bin
```

then copy the downloaded script.bin file to the mounted first partition of the SD card:

```bash
cp script.bin /mnt/sd/boot
sync
umount /dev/sdX1
```

If you wish you can see the source of script.bin file from this link:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OLIMEX/OLINUXINO/master/SOFTWARE/A33/A33-build-3-4-39-1/script.fex
```

At this point you have Debian on your SD card and you have an SD card ready to boot debian on A33-OLinuXino.

Connect USB-SERIAL-CABLE-F to UEXT Tx, Rx and GND.
Put the SD-card apply power according to A33_OLinuXino board type.
You should see u-boot and then kernel messages on the console or LCD.

Under the command line interface you are automatically logged as super user (user ``root``, password ``olimex``).
However, under the graphical environment you are not auto-logged as super user and you must type ``sudo`` before the command (in the GUI the super-user is ``olimex`` and the password is ``olimex``).
