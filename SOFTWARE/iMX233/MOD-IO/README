To compile, type:

```bash
make
```

After that execute the program

```bash
./mod-io [param] [address] [data]
```

1) Set states of the digital outputs on the board

```bash
./mod-io -relay 0x58 0x0F
```

This will toggle the all 4 relays.
0x58 is the default address.

2) Get states of the digital inputs of the board.

```bash
./mod-io -dig 0x58
```

3) Get the voltage applied to one of the analogue inputs of the board.

```bash
./mod-io -an1 0x58
./mod-io -an2 0x58
./mod-io -an3 0x58
./mod-io -an4 0x58
```

4) Set new slave address to the board.

```bash
./mod-io -address 0x58 <new>
```

At the moment of sending this command the BTN must be pressed.
