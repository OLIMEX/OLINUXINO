To compile, type:

  make

After that execute the program

  ./mod-io [param] [address] [data]


1) Set states of the digital outputs on the board

  ./mod-io -relay 0x58 0x0F

This will toggle the all 4 relays.
0x58 is the default address.

2) Get states of the digital inputs of the board. 
  ./mod-io -dig 0x58

3) Get the voltage applied to one of the analogue inputs of the board.

  ./mod-io -an1 0x58
  ./mod-io -an2 0x58
  ./mod-io -an3 0x58
  ./mod-io -an4 0x58

4) Set new slave address to the board.

  ./mod-io -address 0x58 <new>

At the moment of sending this command the BTN must be pressed.
