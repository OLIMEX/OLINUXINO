Official Images from OLIMEX for A20-SOM, A20-OLinuXino-MICRO, A20-OLinuXino-LIME, A20-OLinuXino-LIME2 boards

Note: the SD card images for A20 boards which we have on our webshop contain same image on 8GB Class10 fast micro sd-card, 
if you want to use this image please use Class10 fast card or the performance of Linux will slow down
The image is Debian linux with kernel 3.4.90+ . 
Default login/password: root/olimex

Note that below with XXX is marked the type of Olimex's A20 board, i.e. according the board you use XXX can be OLinuXino_Micro, Lime2, SOM or Lime.
Y in image file name is the number of image revision. 

The file a20-XXX_debian_34_90_release_Y.img.7z is an archive of
a20-XXX_debian_34_90_release_Y.img file. 
So in order to write the image on SD card you have to unzip a20-XXX_debian_34_90_release_Y.img.7z file:
1.1 for Windows
----------------
Use 7zip and then use Win32DiskImager.exe (http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) for image writing

1.2 for linux
-------------
Use p7zip package. If you have no installed 7zip then type 
#apt-get install p7zip
Copy a20-XXX_debian_34_90_release_Y.img.7z file in your directory and unzip it with 
#7za e a20-XXX_debian_34_90_release_Y.img.7z
The output should be a new 4GB file named a20-XXX_debian_34_90_release_Y.img
Put 4GB SD card in your card reader and type
# ls /dev/sd
Then press two times <TAB> you will see a list of your sd devices like sda sdb sdc note that some of these devices may be your hard disk so 
make sure you know which one is your sd card before you proceed as you can damage your HDD if you choose the wrong sd-device. 
You can do this by unplugging your sd card reader and identify which "sd" devices remove from the list.
Once you know which device is your sdcard like sda use this text instead of the sdX name in the references below:

#dd if=a20-XXX_debian_34_90_release_Y.img of=/dev/sdX

The main installed packages are listed below:

The list of all installed packages is located in A20-Olimex-installed-packages.txt file

The main tested onboard hardware modules are:

- GPIO	-	they are located in /sys/class/gpio directory. Note that first you have to export GPIOs. For example:
# for i in `seq 1 1 230`; do echo $i > /sys/class/gpio/export; done
will export all available GPIOs
# echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpioXX_pxx/direction
will make the port output
# echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpioXX_pXX/value
will make the port output in logical 1
- LCD		-	4.3''(480x272), 7''(800x480), 10''(1024x600), 15''(1366x768), 15''(1080x1920)
- SATA	-	with power on/off control and battery support
- HDMI	-	the default HDMI resolution is 720p50(720x1280 - 50 Hz)
- Touch_screen	-	you need calibrate LCD before using touch screen. Note that if you want to use touch screen in X environment then you have to 
calibrate it like olimex user, not like root user because X environment is started like olimex user. For example type:
# su olimex
# sudo ts_calibrate 
calibrate the touch screen and reboot the board
- ASIX8877 USB-LAN	-	https://www.olimex.com/Products/OLinuXino/A13/USB-ETHERNET-AX88772B/. Usually it is eth1 interface
- USB WEB camera A4TECH
- WIFI_RTL8188	-	https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/Ethernet/MOD-WIFI-RTL8188/. Note that you have to set your SSID network and your password in /etc/network/interfaces file
- MOD-WIFI-R5370	-	https://www.olimex.com/Products/USB-Modules/MOD-WIFI-R5370. Note that you have to set your SSID network and your password in /etc/network/interfaces file
- USB_OTG		-	low/full/high USB host 
Note that you can use USB_OTG for SSH connection without need of LAN cable or serial cable. You can use only mini USB cable connected between your host PC
and the onboard mini USB connector. For connection convenience there is started a DHCP server only for USB0 interface. So the DHCP server should give IP address
to the new USB0 interface of your host PC and you can make SSH connection from your PC to the default board IP address of USB0 interface - 192.168.2.1
- USB_HOST_up		-	low/full/high USB host
- USB_HOST_down	-	low/full/high USB host
- MOD-USB3G	-	https://www.olimex.com/Products/USB-Modules/MOD-USB3G/. In order to test MOD-USB3G module you have to place SIM card(without pin code) in module 
and connect it to USB host connector, change settings in /etc/wvdial.conf file according to your mobile operator and type:
# wvdial 3gconnect
- mico_SD_card	- linux starts from micro_SD card
- second_SD_card	-	with card present capability 
- ETHERNET	-	100Mb/1000Mb. By default the board IP address is 192.168.1.254. So if you want to connect with the board using SSH client 
(for example Putty(http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)) then you have to use this address. 
You can change this address from /etc/network/interface file. 
Note that for internet connection you have to set your gateway address in /etc/network/interdaces file and 
you have to set your DNS server in /etc/resolv.conf(for example nameserver 192.168.1.1)
- MIC IN	-	for example:
# arecord -f dat -r 60000 -D hw:0,0 -d 5 test.wav
this command will record 5 sec audio stream from microphone in test.wav file 
- Headphone OUT	-	for example
# aplay -D hw:0,0 test.wav
this command will play the audio stream from test.wav file
- NAND support	-	/dev/nandX
- I2C2(100KHz)	-	/dev/i2c-2
- I2C1(100KHz)	-	/dev/i2c-1
- UART4(only for A20-Lime and A20-Lime2)	-	/dev/ttyS1
- UART6(only for A20-SOM, A20-OLinuXino-MICRO)	-	/dev/ttyS1
- UART7(only for A20-SOM, A20-OLinuXino-MICRO)	-	/dev/ttyS2
- SPI1((only for A20-SOM, A20-OLinuXino-MICRO))	-	/dev/spidev1.0
- SPI2	-	/dev/spidev2.0
there is a simple test for SPI2 in /opt/spidev directory. 
# ls /opt/spidev
max6675/
in folder max6675/ there is example related with MOD-TC(https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/Sensors/MOD-TC/open-source-hardware) - temperature sensor that you have to connect to UEXT1 connector
# cd max6675
# ./MAX6675
the last command will read temperature from MOD-TC thermocouple
- BUTTONs	- we use evtest package for testing. For example:
# evtest
then enter event number for keyboard and now you can press the BUTTONs and you should see the result on terminal window
- on board camera support (only for A20-SOM-EVB)
Note that there is a web server running by default and you can observe camera stream if you type board IP address in your browser
By default the IP address is 192.168.1.254 but you can change it with:
# ifconfig eth0 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX 
Then you have to start the camera using the script below
#  /etc/campipe/capture.sh
with VLC player you can open network stream 
rtsp://A20SOM_IP/live/livestream
and you will see the camera stream too



Changing A20-XXX  HDMI, LCD or VGA resolution 
---------------------------------------------------
The default SD card setup is made with settings for HDMI 720p/50Hz. If you want to change some other LCD, VGA or HDMI resolution then you have to start 
change_display_a20_olimex.sh script file in /root directory.
Type:
# ./change_display_a20_olimex.sh

and choose the desired resolution of desired interface(LCD, HDMI or VGA)
The supported resolution are:

About LCD:
1. 4.3''(480x272)
2. 7''(800x480)
3. 10''(1024x600)
4. 15.6''(1366x768)
5. 15.6''-FHD(1920x1080)

- About 15.6 and 15.6-FHD LCD you can control backlight and DCR(Dinamic Contrast Ratio) using a soft pwm module. The main goal is to decrease power consumption. For example 
# echo 50 > /sys/class/softpwm/backlight/duty
will decrease the LCD backlight to 50%
the parameter for duty is between 0 and 100
# echo 10 > /sys/class/softpwm/duty
will decrease the LCD contrast
the parameter 10 for duty is between 0 and 100 

- About 4.3'', 7'' and 10'' LCD  you can control only backlight a hardware pwm module. The main goal is to decrease power consumption. For example 
# echo 50 > /sys/class/pwm-sunxi/pwm0/duty_percent
will decrease the LCD backlight to 50%
the parameter for duty_percent is between 0 and 100

About HDMI:
0. 480i
1. 576i
2. 480p
3. 576p
4. 720p50
5. 720p60
6. 1080i50
7. 1080i60
8. 1080p24
9. 1080p50
10. 1080p60

About VGA: note that the VGA signals are routed to custom 6 pin connector and you need from adapter to standart VGA connector
0. 1680x1050
1. 1440x900
2. 1360x768
3. 1280x1024
4. 1024x768
5. 800x600
6. 640x480
7. 1920x1080
8. 1280x720 

Changing script.bin file
========================
Note that you have to be very carefull with script.bin changing because the system can stop working. It is recommeded to make backup of script.bin file before change it.
the tools for script.bin changing are located in /opt/sunxi-tools directory
You can change it using simple script file 
# chscr.sh
this will convert script.bin file from sdcard to script.fex file and the file  will be opened using nano editor. 
Now you can change the board modules and parameters, save the changes and exit from nano editor
# wrscr.sh
this will convert script.fex to script.bin and the script.bin file will be written to sdcard

default user/password is root/olimex
