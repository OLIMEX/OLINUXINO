# eqn2graph -- compile EQN equation descriptions to bitmap images
#
# by Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>, July 2002
#
# In Unixland, the magic is in knowing what to string together...
#
# Take an eqn equation on stdin, emit cropped bitmap on stdout.
# The pic markup should *not* be wrapped in .EQ/.EN, this script will do that.
# A -U option on the command line enables gpic/groff "unsafe" mode.
# A -format FOO option changes the image output format to any format
# supported by convert(1).  All other options are passed to convert(1).
# The default format is PNG.
#
# This is separate from pic2graph because pic processing has some weird
# clipping effect on the output, mangling equations that are very wide 
# or deep.  Besides, this tool can supply its own delimiters.
#

# Requires the groff suite and the ImageMagick tools.  Both are open source.
# This code is released to the public domain.
#
# Here are the assumptions behind the option processing:
#
# 1. None of the options of eqn(1) are relevant.
#
# 2. Only the -U option of groff(1) is relevant.
#
# 3. Many options of convert(1) are potentially relevant, (especially 
# -density, -interlace, -transparency, -border, and -comment).
#
# Thus, we pass -U to groff(1), and everything else to convert(1).

# 1. Add .EQ/.EN.
# 2. Process through eqn(1) to emit troff markup.
# 3. Process through groff(1) to emit Postscript.
# 4. Use convert(1) to crop the Postscript and turn it into a bitmap.
